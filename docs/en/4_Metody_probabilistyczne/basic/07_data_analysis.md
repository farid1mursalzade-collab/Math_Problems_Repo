# Task List 07 — Descriptive Statistics from Generated Data

## Introduction

In the previous task lists, probability was studied mainly through theoretical models: sample spaces, events, probability distributions, probability mass functions, density functions, cumulative distribution functions, conditional probability, independence, and Bayes’ formula.

In this task list we change the perspective.

Instead of starting from a fully specified probability model, we start from **data**.  
The data are not given directly. In each problem, students first generate a reproducible dataset using the provided Python script or another suitable technology.

The generated data should then be treated as observed data.

The main question is no longer only:

> What is the probability according to a given mathematical model?

but also:

> What can we learn from data by summarizing, visualizing, and comparing observations?

This is the role of **descriptive statistics**.

In this list, students will practice:

- generating reproducible datasets,
- generating and comparing different random samples,
- saving generated data to CSV files,
- constructing frequency tables,
- computing relative frequencies,
- interpreting empirical distributions,
- computing mean, median, variance, standard deviation, quartiles, and interquartile range,
- identifying outliers,
- drawing histograms, bar charts, boxplots, empirical cumulative distribution functions, and scatter plots,
- comparing groups,
- interpreting relationships between two variables,
- computing covariance and correlation,
- recognizing when a numerical summary may be misleading.

The purpose of this list is not only to compute statistics mechanically.  
Students should also interpret what the computed quantities mean in the context of the data.

Averages, standard deviations, correlations, and plots should always be connected with the real situation represented by the dataset.

## Intended Work Style

These tasks are about **investigating descriptive statistics from data**.

For each dataset, the expected work is not just to produce final numerical answers.  
The expected work is to explore the data, compute descriptive summaries, visualize empirical distributions, compare groups, and explain what the summaries and visualizations show.

If you use AI tools, make the intention clear:

- ask AI to help analyze and explain the dataset, not only to compute isolated numbers,
- ask AI to produce clear visual representations of the data whenever they help understanding,
- use tables and plots together,
- compare empirical distributions across groups, samples, or seeds when this is meaningful,
- use different sample sizes or random seeds to show how random samples fluctuate,
- when a theoretical distribution is available, compare the empirical behavior with the theoretical expectation,
- explain how larger samples usually make empirical patterns more stable,
- describe what can be seen in plots that is not obvious from a single statistic.

Advanced visualizations are welcome.  
Students may use notebooks, dashboards, HTML pages, animations, interactive charts, or any other suitable technology. The key requirement is that the visualization should help understand, present, and explain the data.

---

## General Instructions

In each problem:

1. Generate the dataset using the given Python code or another suitable implementation.
2. Treat the random seed as a tool for reproducibility within the chosen technology. Different technologies may use random seeds differently, so exact values do not have to match across implementations.
3. Save the generated dataset as a CSV file.
4. Use the generated dataset to solve the tasks.
5. Prepare appropriate plots or visual summaries of the data.
6. Treat visualizations as critical tools for understanding, presenting, and explaining data.
7. When variables are grouped or compared, visualize the comparison whenever possible.
8. Use plots to support numerical answers, not to replace them.
9. When possible, generate additional samples with different random seeds and compare their empirical distributions.
10. Use these comparisons to see that random samples vary from seed to seed, even when they come from the same data-generating process.
11. When a theoretical distribution is known, compare empirical distributions with it. Larger samples should usually fluctuate less and stay closer to the theoretical distribution.
12. Explain the meaning of your results in words.

The Python code is provided as a reproducible way to generate the datasets.  
You may use another technology for the analysis and visualization. The important point is to preserve the intended structure of the dataset and to make your procedure reproducible.

If you use Python, the following libraries may be useful:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

You may also use:

```python
df.head()
df.info()
df.describe()
df.value_counts()
df.groupby(...)
```

The random seed is fixed in every problem to make one generated sample reproducible. This does not mean that randomness disappears: changing the seed usually produces a different sample. If another technology is used, document how the data were generated and how reproducibility was handled.

# Problem 1 — Die Rolls and Empirical Distribution

In this problem, we observe many results of rolling a die.

The die is not assumed to be perfectly fair.  
The goal is to compare the observed empirical distribution with the theoretical distribution of a fair die.

## Generate the data

Run the following code:

```python

    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    size=n,
    p=probabilities
)

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "trial": np.arange(1, n + 1),
    "roll": rolls
})

df["is_even"] = df["roll"] % 2 == 0
df["is_at_least_5"] = df["roll"] >= 5

df.to_csv("problem_01_die_rolls.csv", index=False)

df.head()
```

## Tasks

1. Describe what one row of the dataset represents.
2. Construct an absolute frequency table for the variable `roll`.
3. Construct a relative frequency table for the variable `roll`.
4. Draw a bar chart of the empirical distribution. Include the fair-die probabilities as a visual reference if possible.
5. Compute the empirical probability of the following events:
   - the result is even,
   - the result is at least 5,
   - the result is equal to 6.
6. Compare the empirical distribution with the theoretical distribution of a fair die.
7. Explain why empirical frequencies do not have to be exactly equal to theoretical probabilities.
8. Decide whether the die appears to be fair based only on the generated data. Justify your answer.

# Final Problem — Short Statistical Report

Choose any three datasets generated in this task list.

For each chosen dataset, prepare a short statistical report.

The report should contain:

1. a short description of the data,
2. information about the number of observations and variables,
3. at least one frequency table,
4. at least one numerical summary,
5. at least one histogram or bar chart,
6. at least one boxplot, empirical CDF, or scatter plot,
7. one comparison between groups, if the dataset contains groups,
8. one interpretation involving empirical probability, conditional frequency, or correlation,
9. one warning about a possible misuse of a numerical summary,
10. a short conclusion written in words.

The report should not consist only of code and numerical output.  
Every computed statistic should be interpreted in the context of the data.
